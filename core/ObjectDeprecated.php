/**
 * Base class in Lithium's hierarchy, from which all concrete classes inherit. This class defines
 * several conventions for how classes in Lithium should be structured:
 *
 * - **Universal constructor**: Any class which defines a `__construct()` method should take
 *   exactly one parameter (`$config`), and that parameter should always be an array. Any settings
 *   passed to the constructor will be stored in the `$_config` property of the object.
 * - **Initialization / automatic configuration**: After the constructor, the `_init()` method is
 *   called. This method can be used to initialize the object, keeping complex logic and
 *   high-overhead or difficult to test operations out of the constructor. This method is called
 *   automatically by `Object::__construct()`, but may be disabled by passing `'init' => false` to
 *   the constructor. The initializer is also used for automatically assigning object properties.
 *   See the documentation on the `_init()` method for more details.
 * - **Testing / misc.**: The `__set_state()` method provides a default implementation of the PHP
 *   magic method (works with `var_export()`) which can instantiate an object with a static method
 *   call. Finally, the `_stop()` method may be used instead of `exit()`, as it can be overridden
 *   for testing purposes.
 *
 * @deprecated
 * @link http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#object.set-state
 * @see lithium\core\StaticObject

	 * to `false`. May be used for testing purposes, where objects need to be manipulated in an
	 * un-initialized state, or for high-overhead operations that require more control than the
	 * constructor provides. Additionally, this method iterates over the `$_autoConfig` property
	 * to automatically assign configuration settings to their corresponding properties.
	 *
	 * For example, given the following:
	 * ```
	 * class Bar extends \lithium\core\Object {
	 * 	protected $_autoConfig = ['foo'];
	 * 	protected $_foo;
	 * }
	 *
	 * $instance = new Bar(['foo' => 'value']);
	 * ```
	 *
	 * The `$_foo` property of `$instance` would automatically be set to `'value'`. If `$_foo` was
	 * an array, `$_autoConfig` could be set to `['foo' => 'merge']`, and the constructor value
	 * of `'foo'` would be merged with the default value of `$_foo` and assigned to it.
